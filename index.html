<h3> About Myself </h3>
  <p>Hi! My name is Babette. I am fourteen years old. I live in Kerkdriel with my parents and sisters. 
    We have three pets: the rabbits Rebel, Nibbit and Pheebe. I have brown hair, blue eyes and I am tall.
    My sports are Horseriding and Dancing. My hobbies are painting and drawing, reading and photograph. 
    I go to ds. Pierson college in den Bosch. I love collecting crystals and special stones! </p>
<h3>School</h3>
  <p>As I said before, I go to ds. Pierson College in den Bosch. I travel there with my friend Veronica, she also goes to the Pierson College. My favourite lessons are art subject
and French. My least favourite are German, Physics and Dutch. My lowest average is a 6,8 for Physics. There are 28 students in my class. 15 boys and 13 girls. My mentor is mrs. van de Berselaar.
    My longest day on school is from 8.45 to 16.20. My shortest is from 9.55 to 14.30. When I am home, I always make homework for tomorrow. When I get a test, I begin a week before the test. 
 </p>
<h3>Free Time</h3>
  <p>In my free time, I love to draw on my drawing tablet. I got that for my fourteenth birthday! I think it is much easier to draw on the tablet than on paper. The colors also are nicer online then on paper.
  On thursday, I have horse riding. I mostly ride on big horses. A year ago I rode on ponies. Once a month, I go to a crystal store in Veghel. The other days of the month, I make a list
  of stones that I want. When I go to the shop, I buy some of them. I also like to read when I have nothing to do. My favourite bookseries are A Court of Thorns and Roses, Gild and Throne of Glass.
  I love to call with my friends and go shopping with them. They always make my day better!</p>
